  <ol>
    <li>You want to travel the world with a beautiful boy like Kevin.</li>
  <li>You want to be high on energy while doing that, so you need a healthy body.</li>
  <li>You want to be using your gifts and pursuing your passions to bring beauty into the creation, <br> so you can fulfill your purpose as infinite being in this life form.</li>
  <li>You want to have a positive vibe about you, so you can move energy in positive ways <br> to create positive and divinely beautiful things.</li>
  <li>Very importantly, you don't wanna be worrying about small existential things like money.</li>
  <li>You want to be lead intuitively by infinite being and be creative in ways this body was designed to do.</li>
  <li>You want to reach a stage where you help others identify their divine purpose rather than being gullible and getting discouraged in your purpose by their small-mindedness.</li>
  <li>You want to have steely self-confidence in your purpose, abilities and value in human society.</li>
</ol>
